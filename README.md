# I see your web assembly, and raise you shell assembly!


    Q: What is this?

A processor emulator using a custom ISA, that I'm slowly banging out over time.


    Q: Why is this?

Like many of my projects, this exists to hone my programming skills as well as further my understanding of CS as a whole.


    Q: Are you aware there's obvious areas your code could be made shorter?

Yes. This project is a bit of a challenge for me, and I find it easier on my brain to follow the code flow the way it is.


    Q: Does this have any practical use-cases?
